<h1>📚 RSL Book Restoration Service</h1>

<h2>💡 Overview</h2>

<p>RSL Book Restoration Service is a web-based application developed by RSL library that provides book restoration services for damaged books. The general idea for this project came from Alexey Kascheev, who told about it to Pavel Lushnikov. The man responsible for this project is Vasin Vitaliy, with help from Menshikov Maxim.</p>

<p>The application uses advanced computer vision technology to detect and repair damage to books. Restorers can upload photos of damaged books to the website, and the application uses the Detectron2 semantic segmentation engine to identify the type and extent of damage to the books. The application can detect eight different types of damage, including fire damage, torn pages, mold, creases, insect damage, gnawing, water damage, and spots. Once the application has analyzed the photos, it generates a metadata file that provides information about the extent and type of damage to the books. This information can be used to guide the restoration process and help restore the books to their former glory.</p>
